			<h2>What is BPA?</h2>
			<p>BPA (Business Professionals of America) is a business club focused on building business skills to apply to the real world and transforming students into future leaders of America. The club is student driven and allows members to focus on different aspects of business such as finance, accounting, marketing and management, learning new skills through competitive events based around these topics.  In addition to the business skills that students will learn, many members compete in events that allow them to expand their knowledge in non-business fields such as technology and medicine.</p>

			<!--<p>BPA is also the leading CTSO (Career and Technical Student Organization) for students pursuing careers in business management, office administration, information technology and other related career fields.</p>-->

			<p>The Workplace Skills Assessment Program (WSAP) prepares students to succeed and assesses real-world business skills and problem solving abilities in finance, management, IT and computer applications. It is BPA's showcase program and facilitates students demonstrating their career skills at regional, state and national conferences in 59 competitive events.</p>

			<p>At Business Professionals of America, we are committed to developing the best possible career and technical education organization for students in the United States. The measure of our success will be the perception that alumni of Business Professionals of America are highly competent and skilled workforce professionals who enable business and industry to maintain the economic vitality and high quality of life associated with our celebrated United States of America.</p>
